While the course will briefly explain these topics, it will not cover the theory and statistics behind these concepts in detail.\nNo prior experience with programming or computer science is needed, although a positive attitude towards these topics is necessary."

    "text": "Course structure\nThe material is planned for 12 weeks with one session per week. Each session is divided into three parts - Concepts, Hands-on and Exercise, following the model proposed by Arribas-Bel (2019). Concepts have a form of a lecture covering conceptual aspects of the topic of the day, providing necessary theoretical background before digging into code. This part can be nicknamed “I do”. Hands-on contains documented code in a form of a Jupyter notebook which is executed in parallel by a lecturer, providing an additional explanation, and by students. Therefore, we have a part “We do”. Exercise is a set of tasks that are to be performed by students individually, with an occasional guidance by the lecturer. So we finish the day with “You do”.\nFor enrolled students of Charles University, the course will finish with a written assignment in a form of a computational essay. See the Assignment section for details."
