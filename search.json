It includes:\n\nAdvancing their statistical and numerical literacy.\nIntroducing basic principles of programming and state-of-the-art computational tools for SDS.\nPresenting a comprehensive overview of the main methodologies available to the Spatial Data Scientist and their intuition on how and when they can be applied.\nFocusing on real-world applications of these techniques in a geographical and applied context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it only for social geography?\n\n\n\nThe course revolves around data typically used in social geography, but its applicability is not limited to social geography. In practice, you will work more with vector data than rasters (although we cover those a bit as well) and often with data capturing various aspects of human life. The spatial data science concepts, however, are universal."

While the course will briefly explain these topics, it will not cover the theory and statistics behind these concepts in detail.\nNo prior experience with programming or computer science is needed, although a positive attitude towards these topics is necessary."

    "text": "Course structure\nThe material is planned for 12 weeks, with one session per week. Each session is divided into three parts - Concepts, Hands-on and Exercise, following the model proposed by Arribas-Bel (2019). Concepts have a form of a lecture covering conceptual aspects of the day’s topic, providing necessary theoretical background before digging into code. This part can be nicknamed “I do”. Hands-on contains documented code in a Jupyter notebook, executed in parallel by a lecturer, providing an additional explanation, and by students. Therefore, we have a part “We do”. Exercise is a set of tasks to be performed by students individually, with occasional guidance by the lecturer. So we finish the day with “You do”.\nFor enrolled students of Charles University, the course will finish with a written assignment in the form of a computational essay. See the Assignment section for details."

Using the online version over the printed one is recommended, although this is entirely up to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial or geographic data science?\n\n\n\nSpatial data science and geographic data science are often treated as synonyms. In some interpretations, spatial is broader than geographic. In this case, we do spatial […] for […] geography, which is, in principle, geographic data science. We will treat both terms as equal within the context of this course."

People designing the tools are often computer scientists or have a strong knowledge of CS-related environments. It means we sometimes need to deal with the tools that look a bit scary, like a Terminal or a Command line. Below is a brief introduction to the tools you will need for this course.\n\nTerminal and Command line\nDepending on your operating system, you will have either Terminal (macOS, Linux) or Command line application installed. It will look like this:\n\n\n\nTerminal on macOS\n\n\nTerminal (and Command line, but we will refer to both as the terminal for simplicity) is used to interact with applications that do not have any graphic interface or with the apps that do have one, but you want to use them programmatically. The terminal usage is straightforward. Let’s start with a few examples.\nYou want to see a list of files and folders for this course. First, you need to navigate to the correct folder. For that, you can use the cd command, which stands for current directory.\ncd university/sds/\nLet’s assume that you have the folder with course material in the folder called sds in another folder called university. The full command is then composed of the cd part, saying set the current directory to… and waits for the parameter, which is a path to the folder in this case - university/sds/.\nOnce in the correct folder, you can use another command, ls, which stands for list and allows you to list the contents of the current directory.\nls\nThe output would look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput of the ls command.\n\n\nYou can also pass a parameter -l, specifying that you want a long listing including attributes.\nls -l\nThat changes the output to this:\n\n\n\nOutput of the ls -l command.\n\n\nThe syntax is always the same, starting with the app name and then followed by parameters."

It is a package manager, ensuring all the necessary parts work together. For example, if you want to create a new environment and install Python in it, you type the following command in your terminal.\nmamba create -n my_environment python\nYou can check more in the documentation of mamba.\n\nOther options\nMamba is not the only way of doing this. If you don’t want to install anything on your local machine, you can use Google Colab, which gives you an environment with Python and an interface to work with Jupyter Notebooks.

Jupyter Lab is a handy interface allowing you to work with multiple notebooks and switch between your Python environments created with mamba.\nIt is time to say goodbye to the terminal and start Jupyter Lab. You should ensure you have your sds environment activated first:\nmamba activate sds\nThen you can start Lab using:\njupyter lab\nThis command should open your browser and load the Jupyter Lab interface.\n\n\n\nJupyter Lab interface\n\n\nIn the launcher, we can create a new Notebook by clicking on the Python logo representing our current environment. If you have more of them, you will see them there, as well as other environments using different programming languages like R or Julia.\nThe notebook is composed of cells. This is a cell:\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebook cell\n\n\nCells can contain either code or text. A typical notebook is then a series of cells where some include text describing what is happening while others contain the code, either waiting for execution or already executed. The cells with the executed code may also contain outputs.\nWe can start with simple math that Python can do natively. Run the following code cell. To do that, you can either click the “play” button on top or hit Shift + Enter:\n\n1 + 1\n\n2\n\n\nYou now have a code cell with the output. Jupyter Lab automatically created a new cell.

    "text": "Let the snake in\nYou can start exploring Python.\n\nSimple Python math\nAs shown above, Python can be used as a simple calculator. Remember, you can press Shift + Enter to execute the code in the cells below. Try it out by typing some simple math into new cells and see what you get.\n\n42 * 12\n\n504\n\n\n\n12 / 3\n\n4.0\n\n\nIf you want to edit and re-run some code, change the cell and press Shift + Enter to execute the modified code.\n\n\nFunctions\nYou can use Python for more advanced math by using a function. Functions are pieces of code that perform a single action, such as printing information to the screen (e.g., the print() function). Functions exist for a huge number of operations in Python.\nLet’s try out a few simple examples using functions to find the sine or square root of a value. You can type sin(3) or sqrt(4) into the cells below to test this out.\n\nsin(3)\n\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined\n\n\n\nsqrt(4)\n\nNameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined\n\n\nWell, that didn’t work. Python can calculate square roots or do basic trigonometry, but we need one more step.\n\nMath operations\nThe table below shows the list of basic arithmetic operations that can be done by default in Python.\n\n\n\nOperation\nSymbol\nExample syntax\nReturned value\n\n\n\n\nAddition\n+\n2 + 2\n4\n\n\nSubtraction\n-\n4 - 2\n2\n\n\nMultiplication\n*\n2 * 3\n6\n\n\nDivision\n/\n4 / 2\n2\n\n\nExponentiation\n**\n2 ** 3\n8\n\n\n\nFor anything more advanced, we need to load a module or a package. For math operations, this module is called math and can be loaded by typing import math.\n\nimport math\n\nNow that we have access to functions in the math module, we can use it by typing the module name, a period (dot), and the name of the function we want to use. For example, math.sin(3). Try this with the sine and square root examples from above.\n\nmath.sin(3)\n\n0.1411200080598672\n\n\n\nmath.sqrt(4)\n\n2.0\n\n\nLet’s summarise what you’ve just done with modules:\n\nA module is a group of code items, such as functions, related to one another. Individual modules are often in a group called a package.\nModules can be loaded using import. Functions that are part of the module modulename can then be used by typing modulename.functionname(). For example, sin() is a function that is part of the math module and is used by typing math.sin() with some number between the parentheses.\nWithin a Jupyter Notebook, the variables you defined earlier in the notebook will be available for use in the following cells as long as you have executed the cells.\nModules may also contain constants such as math.pi (notice no parentheses at the end). Type this in the cell below to see the constant’s math.pi value.\n\n\nmath.pi\n\n3.141592653589793\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\nUse the empty Python cell to calculate the sine of pi. What value do you expect for this calculation? Did you get the desired result?\n\n\nCode\n# Here is an example solution\nmath.sin(math.pi)\n\n\n\n\nCombining functions\nFunctions can also be combined. The print() function returns values within the parentheses as text on the screen. Below, try printing the value of the square root of four.\n\nprint(math.sqrt(4))\n\n2.0\n\n\nYou can also combine text with other calculated values using the print() function. For example, print('Two plus two is', 2+2) would generate the text reading 'Two plus two is 4'. Combine the print() function with the math.sqrt() function in the cell below to produce text that reads 'The square root of 4 is 2.0'.\n\nprint(\"The square root of 4 is\", math.sqrt(4))\n\nThe square root of 4 is 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nA variable can store values calculated in expressions and used for other calculations. Assigning value to variables is straightforward. To assign a value, you type variable_name = value, where variable_name is the name of the variable you wish to define. In the cell below, define a variable called temp_celsius, assign it a value of 10.0, and then print that variable value using the print() function. Note that you should do this on two separate lines.\n\ntemp_celsius = 10.0\nprint(temp_celsius)\n\n10.0\n\n\nAs we did above, you can combine text and even use some math when printing out variable values. The idea is similar to adding 2+2 or calculating the square root of four from the previous section. In the cell below, print out the value of temp_celsius in degrees Fahrenheit by multiplying temp_celsius by 9/5 and adding 32. This should be done within the print() function to produce output that reads 'Temperature in Fahrenheit: 50.0'.\n\nprint(\"Temperature in Fahrenheit:\", 9 / 5 * temp_celsius + 32)\n\nTemperature in Fahrenheit: 50.0\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\nUse the empty Python cell below to define a variable and print its value to the screen using the print() function. The variable value can be anything you like, and you can even consider defining several variables and printing them out together. Consider using pothole_case_naming for your variable name.\n\n\nCode\n# Here is an example solution\npart1 = \"I like\"\npart2 = \"Python!\"\nprint(part1, part2)\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating variables\nValues stored in variables can also be updated. Let’s redefine the value of temp_celsius to be equal to 15.0 and print its value in the cells below.\n\ntemp_celsius = 15.0\n\n\nprint(\"temperature in Celsius is now:\", temp_celsius)\n\ntemperature in Celsius is now: 15.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you try to run some code that accesses a variable that has not yet been defined, you will get a NameError message. Try printing out the value of the variable temp_fahrenheit using the print() function in the cell below.\n\n\n\nprint(\"Temperature in Celsius:\", 5 / 9 * (temp_fahrenheit - 32))\n\nNameError: name 'temp_fahrenheit' is not defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the interesting things here is that if we define the undefined variable in a cell lower down in the notebook and execute that cell, we can return to the earlier cell, and the code should now work. That was a bit of a complicated sentence, so let’s test this all out. First, let’s define a variable called temp_fahrenheit in the cell below and assign it to be equal to 9/5 * temp_celsius + 32, the conversion factor from temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit. Then, return to the cell above this text and run that cell again. See how the error message has gone away? temp_fahrenheit has now been defined, and thus, the cell above no longer generates a NameError when the code is executed.\nAlso, the number beside the cell, for example, In [2], tells you the order in which the Python cells have been executed. This way, you can see a history of the order in which you have run the cells.\n\n\n\ntemp_fahrenheit = 9 / 5 * temp_celsius + 32\n\nTo check their current values, print out the values of temp_celsius and temp_fahrenheit in the cell below.\n\nprint(\"temperature in Celsius:\", temp_celsius, \"and in Fahrenheit:\", temp_fahrenheit)\n\ntemperature in Celsius: 15.0 and in Fahrenheit: 59.0\n\n\n\n\nData types\nA data type determines the characteristics of data in a program. There are four basic data types in Python, as shown in the table below.\n\n\n\nData type name\nData type\nExample\n\n\n\n\nint\nWhole integer values\n4\n\n\nfloat\nDecimal values\n3.1415\n\n\nstr\nCharacter strings\n'Hot'\n\n\nbool\nTrue/false values\nTrue\n\n\n\nThe data type can be found using the type() function. As you will see, the data types are essential because some are incompatible.\nLet’s define a variable weather_forecast and assign it the value 'Hot'. After this, we can check its data type using the type() function.\n\nweather_forecast = \"Hot\"\ntype(weather_forecast)\n\nstr\n\n\nLet’s also check the type of temp_fahrenheit. What happens if you try to combine temp_fahrenheit and weather_forecast in a single math equation such as temp_fahrenheit = temp_fahrenheit + 5.0 * weather_forecast?\n\ntype(temp_fahrenheit)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\ntemp_fahrenheit = temp_fahrenheit + 5.0 * weather_forecast\n\nTypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'\n\n\nIn this case, we get at TypeError because we are trying to execute a math operation with data types that are not compatible. There is no way in Python to multiply numbers with a character string.\n\nCheck your understanding\nAs it turns out, you can do some math with character strings in Python. Define two variables and assign them character string values in the Python cell below. What happens if you try to add two character strings together? Can you subtract them? Which other math operations work for character strings?\n\n\nCode\n# Here is an example solution\n\nfirst_variable = \"Python\"\nsecond_variable = \" is cool!\"\n\nprint(first_variable + second_variable)\nprint(5 * first_variable)\nprint(first_variable - second_variable)"

To practise its syntax, try to reproduce the following Wikipedia entry:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_R._Tobler\n\nYou should be able to figure out the proper Markdown syntax by yourself, with some help from your favourite search engine or AI (yes, usage of AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard is allowed and possible even encouraged in this course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDo not overthink it. Focus on correctly formatting the bold, italics, links, headlines, and lists, but don’t worry too much about the overall layout. Bonus if you also manage to insert the image (it does not need to be properly placed as on the original page)!"

What are Jupyter notebooks, how do they work, and how do you run Python in them. It is time to start using them for data science (no, that simple math you did the last time doesn’t count as data science).\nYou are about to enter the PyData ecosystem. It means that you will start learning how to work with Python from the middle. This course does not explicitly cover the fundamentals of programming. It is expected that those parts you need you’ll be able to pick as you go through the specialised data science stack. If you’re stuck, confused or need further explanation, use Google (or your favourite search engine), ask AI to explain the code or ask in Slack or during the class. Not everything will be told during the course (by design), and the internet is a friend of every programmer, so let’s figure out how to use it efficiently from the beginning.\nLet’s dig in!"

    "text": "Munging and wrangling\nReal-world datasets are messy. There is no way around it: datasets have “holes” (missing data), the amount of formats in which data can be stored is endless, and the best structure to share data is not always the optimum to analyse them, hence the need to munge1 them. As has been correctly pointed out in many outlets, much of the time spent in what is called Data Science is related not only to sophisticated modelling and insight but has to do with much more basic and less exotic tasks such as obtaining data, processing, and turning them into a shape that makes analysis possible, and exploring it to get to know their basic properties.\nSurprisingly, very little has been published on patterns, techniques, and best practices for quick and efficient data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation because of how labour-intensive and relevant this aspect is. In this session, you will use a few real-world datasets and learn how to process them into Python so they can be transformed and manipulated, if necessary, and analysed. For this, you will introduce some of the bread and butter of data analysis and scientific computing in Python. These are fundamental tools that are constantly used in almost any task relating to data analysis.\nThis notebook covers the basics and the content that is expected to be learnt by every student. You use a prepared dataset that saves us much of the more intricate processing that goes beyond the introductory level the session is aimed at. If you are interested in how it was done, there is a notebook.\nThis notebook discusses several patterns to clean and structure data properly, including tidying, subsetting, and aggregating. You finish with some basic visualisation. An additional extension presents more advanced tricks to manipulate tabular data."

    "text": "Dataset\nYou will be exploring demographic characteristics of Chicago in 1918 linked to the influenza mortality during the pandemic that happened back then, coming from the research paper by Grantz et al. (2016). The data are aggregated to census tracts and contain information on unemployment, home ownership, age structure and influenza mortality from a period of 8 weeks.\nThe main tool you use is the pandas package. As with the math you used before, you must import it first.\n\n1import pandas as pd\n\n\n1\n\nImport the pandas package under the alias pd. Using the alias is not necessary, but it is a convention nearly everyone follows.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is stored in a CSV file. To make things easier, you can read data from a file posted online so, for now, you do not need to download any dataset:\n\n1chicago_1918 = pd.read_csv(\n2    \"https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/chapter_02/data/chicago_influenza_1918.csv\",\n3    index_col=\"geography_code\",\n)\n\n\n1\n\nUse the read_csv function from pandas. Remember that you have imported pandas as pd.\n\n2\n\nSpecify the path to the file. It could be a web address like here or a local file path.\n\n3\n\nUse the column geography_code as an index of the table by passing its name to the index_col keyword argument. It is not strictly necessary but allows us to choose and index on reading instead of specifying it later. More on indices below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou are using read_csv because the file you want to read is in CSV format. However, pandas allows for many more formats to be read and write. A full list of formats supported may be found in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\nInstead of reading the file directly off the web, it is possible to download it manually, store it on your computer, and read it locally. To do that, you can follow these steps:\n\nDownload the file by right-clicking on this link and saving the file\nPlace the file in the same folder as the notebook where you intend to read it\nReplace the code in the cell above with:\n\nchicago_1918 = pd.read_csv(\n    \"chicago_influenza_1918.csv\",\n    index_col=\"geography_code\",\n)"

What you have at your fingertips is a table summarising, for each of the census tracts in Chicago more than a century ago, how many people lived in each by age, accompanied by some other socioeconomic data and influenza mortality. These tables are called DataFrame objects, and they have a lot of functionality built-in to explore and manipulate the data they contain. Let’s explore a few of those cool tricks!\n\nData Structures\nThe first aspect worth spending a bit of time on is the structure of a DataFrame.

Since they represent a table of data, DataFrame objects have two dimensions: rows and columns. Each of these is automatically assigned a name in what you will call its index. When printing, the index of each dimension is rendered in bold, as opposed to the standard rendering for the content. The example above shows how the column index is automatically picked up from the .csv file’s column names. For rows, we have specified when reading the file you wanted the column geography_code, so that is used. If you hadn’t set any, pandas would automatically generate a sequence starting in 0 and going all the way to the number of rows minus one. This is the standard structure of a DataFrame object, so you will come to it over and over. Importantly, even when you move to spatial data, your datasets will have a similar structure.\nOne final feature that is worth mentioning about these tables is that they can hold columns with different types of data. In this example, you have counts (or int for integer types) and ratios (or ‘float’ for floating point numbers - a number with decimals) for each column. But it is useful to keep in mind that you can combine this with columns that hold other types of data such as categories, text (str, for string), dates or, as you will see later in the course, geographic features.\nTo extract a single column from this DataFrame, specify its name in the square brackets ([]). Note that the name, in this case, is a string. A piece of text. As such, it needs to be within single (') or double quotes (\"). The resulting data structure is no longer a DataFrame, but you have a Series because you deal with a single column.\n\nchicago_1918[\"influenza\"]\n\ngeography_code\nG17003100001     9\nG17003100002     6\nG17003100003     8\nG17003100004     2\nG17003100005     7\n                ..\nG17003100492    12\nG17003100493    40\nG17003100494    85\nG17003100495    15\nG17003100496    30\nName: influenza, Length: 496, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nInspect\nInspecting what it looks like.

Using .loc[], you select all the rows (: part) and all the columns between \"agecat1\" and \"agecat7\".

For example, if you want to extract the influenza mortality and total population of the first four areas in the table, you use loc with lists:\n\n1death_pop_first4 = chicago_1918.loc[\n2    [\"G17003100001\", \"G17003100002\", \"G17003100003\", \"G17003100004\"],\n3    [\"influenza\", \"total_population\"],\n]\ndeath_pop_first4\n\n\n1\n\nloc takes two inputs. Selection of rows and selection of columns. If the latter is not present, it is assumed that all the columns are selected. The same could be achieved by using :.\n\n2\n\nA list of index values. Note that you use squared brackets ([]) to delineate the index of the items you want to subset. In Python, this sequence of items is called a list.\n\n3\n\nA list of columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100001\n9\n2819\n\n\nG17003100002\n6\n3265\n\n\nG17003100003\n8\n2256\n\n\nG17003100004\n2\n2623\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how you can create a list with the names (index IDs) along each of the two dimensions of a DataFrame (rows and columns), and loc will return a subset of the original table only with the elements queried for.\nAn alternative to list-based queries is what is called “range-based” queries. These work on the indices of the table, but instead of requiring the ID of each item you want to retrieve, they operate by requiring only two IDs: the first and last element in a range of items. Range queries are expressed with a colon (:). For example:\n\nrange_query = chicago_1918.loc[\n    \"G17003100010\":\"G17003100012\",\n    \"influenza\":'total_population',\n]\nrange_query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100010\n18\n11380\n\n\nG17003100011\n16\n8382\n\n\nG17003100012\n8\n5874\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range query picks up all the elements between the specified IDs. Note that for this to work, the first ID in the range needs to be placed before the second one in the table’s index.\nOnce you know about list and range-based queries, you can combine them! For example, you can specify a range of rows and a list of columns:\n\nrange_list_qry = chicago_1918.loc[\n    \"G17003100010\":\"G17003100012\", [\"influenza\", \"total_population\"]\n]\n\nrange_list_qry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100010\n18\n11380\n\n\nG17003100011\n16\n8382\n\n\nG17003100012\n8\n5874\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition-based queries\nHowever, sometimes, you do not know exactly which observations you want, but you do know what conditions they need to satisfy (e.g. areas with more than 2,000 inhabitants). For these cases, DataFrames support selection based on conditions. Let us see a few examples. Suppose you want to select…\n… areas with more than 60 cases of influenza deaths:\n\nflu_over_60 = chicago_1918.loc[chicago_1918[\"influenza\"] &gt; 60]\nflu_over_60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100196\n80.5\n951\n0.301564\n0.016648\n228\n1504\n925\n998\n608\n3583\n1092\n62\n8938\n\n\nG17003100246\n113.0\n2596\n0.330517\n0.027537\n407\n2090\n1497\n1681\n1063\n4564\n1934\n77\n13236\n\n\nG17003100247\n91.1\n1534\n0.293748\n0.020664\n215\n1136\n770\n775\n530\n2993\n1152\n61\n7571\n\n\nG17003100285\n120.0\n621\n0.318677\n0.047779\n419\n1870\n1190\n1263\n818\n4370\n1335\n82\n11265\n\n\nG17003100352\n600.0\n638\n0.267962\n0.055023\n404\n1962\n1251\n1151\n603\n5261\n1251\n70\n11883\n\n\nG17003100494\n1392.8\n1504\n0.336032\n0.072317\n309\n1779\n1252\n1598\n1086\n6235\n2673\n85\n14932\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… areas with less than 200 inhabitants:\n\npop_under = chicago_1918.loc[chicago_1918[\"total_population\"] &lt; 200]\npop_under\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100093\n71.2\n34\n0.268041\n0.025773\n4\n33\n20\n25\n10\n66\n36\n0\n194\n\n\nG17003100293\n40.0\n17\n0.345238\n0.053571\n4\n23\n18\n26\n16\n59\n22\n0\n168\n\n\nG17003100297\n38.1\n4\n0.461538\n0.000000\n0\n3\n1\n4\n0\n8\n10\n0\n26\n\n\nG17003100353\n320.0\n28\n0.193750\n0.018750\n1\n7\n4\n10\n12\n80\n46\n2\n160\n\n\nG17003100488\n1600.1\n3\n0.404762\n0.000000\n2\n5\n4\n7\n1\n17\n6\n0\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… areas with exactly a hundred illiterate persons:\n\nillit_100 = chicago_1918.loc[chicago_1918[\"illit\"] == 100]\nillit_100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100076\n79.4\n100\n0.326936\n0.043691\n140\n791\n562\n666\n520\n3163\n1496\n20\n7338\n\n\nG17003100483\n670.0\n100\n0.379153\n0.142368\n188\n1170\n829\n1132\n763\n3191\n1482\n21\n8755\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlimited power\n\n\n\nThese queries can grow in sophistication with almost no limits.

This is a powerful way, and since it shares syntax with index-based queries, it is also easier to remember. However, sometimes querying using loc involves a lot of quotation marks, parenthesis, etc. A more streamlined approach for condition-based queries of rows is provided by the query engine. Using this approach, you express everything in our query on a single string, or piece of text, and that is evaluated in the table at once. For example, you can run the same operation as in the first query above with the following syntax:\n\nflu_over_60_query = chicago_1918.query(\"influenza &gt; 60\")\nflu_over_60_query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100196\n80.5\n951\n0.301564\n0.016648\n228\n1504\n925\n998\n608\n3583\n1092\n62\n8938\n\n\nG17003100246\n113.0\n2596\n0.330517\n0.027537\n407\n2090\n1497\n1681\n1063\n4564\n1934\n77\n13236\n\n\nG17003100247\n91.1\n1534\n0.293748\n0.020664\n215\n1136\n770\n775\n530\n2993\n1152\n61\n7571\n\n\nG17003100285\n120.0\n621\n0.318677\n0.047779\n419\n1870\n1190\n1263\n818\n4370\n1335\n82\n11265\n\n\nG17003100352\n600.0\n638\n0.267962\n0.055023\n404\n1962\n1251\n1151\n603\n5261\n1251\n70\n11883\n\n\nG17003100494\n1392.8\n1504\n0.336032\n0.072317\n309\n1779\n1252\n1598\n1086\n6235\n2673\n85\n14932\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to combine operations, this is also possible:\n\nflu_query = chicago_1918.query(\"(influenza &gt; 60) & (total_population &lt; 10000)\")\nflu_query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100196\n80.5\n951\n0.301564\n0.016648\n228\n1504\n925\n998\n608\n3583\n1092\n62\n8938\n\n\nG17003100247\n91.1\n1534\n0.293748\n0.020664\n215\n1136\n770\n775\n530\n2993\n1152\n61\n7571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, in these cases, using query results in code that is much more streamlined and easier to read.

For example, imagine you want areas with more than 60 cases of influenza from areas with less than 10,000 inhabitants:\n\nflu_loc = chicago_1918.loc[\n    (chicago_1918[\"influenza\"] &gt; 60)\n1    & (chicago_1918[\"total_population\"] &lt; 10000)\n]\nflu_loc\n\n\n1\n\nThe & operator combines both conditions together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngross_acres\nillit\nunemployed_pct\nho_pct\nagecat1\nagecat2\nagecat3\nagecat4\nagecat5\nagecat6\nagecat7\ninfluenza\ntotal_population\n\n\ngeography_code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG17003100196\n80.5\n951\n0.301564\n0.016648\n228\n1504\n925\n998\n608\n3583\n1092\n62\n8938\n\n\nG17003100247\n91.1\n1534\n0.293748\n0.020664\n215\n1136\n770\n775\n530\n2993\n1152\n61\n7571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the loc queries work?\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s unpack how these queries work.

For example, imagine you want to sort the table by the influenza cases:\n\n1chicago_sorted = chicago_1918.sort_values('influenza', ascending=False)\nchicago_sorted\n\n\n1\n\nBy default, pandas is sorting from the smallest to the largest values (ascending).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nThe next step to continue exploring a dataset is to get a feel for what it looks like, visually. You have already learnt how to unconver and inspect specific parts of the data, to check for particular cases you might be interested in. Now, you will see how to plot the data to get a sense of the overall distribution of values. For that, you can use the plotting capabilities of pandas.\n\nHistograms\nOne of the most common graphical devices to display the distribution of values in a variable is a histogram. Values are assigned into groups of equal intervals, and the groups are plotted as bars rising as high as the number of values into the group.\nA histogram is easily created with the following command. In this case, let us have a look at the shape of the overall influenza rates:\n\n_ = chicago_1918[\"influenza\"].plot.hist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning to _\n\n\n\n\n\npandas returns an object with the drawing from its plotting methods. Since you are in Jupyter environment, and you don’t need to work further with that object; you can assign it to _, a convention for an unused variable.\n\n\n\nHowever, the default pandas plots can be a bit dull. A better option is to use another package, called seaborn.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy sns?\n\n\n\n\n\nseaborn is, by convention, imported as sns. That came as a joke after Samuel Normal Seaborn, a fictional character The West Wing show.\n\n\n\nThe same plot using seaborn has a more pleasant default style and more customisability.\n\nsns.displot(chicago_1918[\"influenza\"])\n\n/home/runner/micromamba/envs/sds/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote you are using sns instead of pd, as the function belongs to seaborn instead of pandas.\nYou can quickly see most of the areas have seen somewhere between 0 and 60 cases, approx. However, there are a few areas that have more, up to more than 80 cases.\n\n\nKernel Density Plots\nHistograms are useful, but they are artificial in the sense that a continuous variable is made discrete by turning the values into discrete groups. An alternative is kernel density estimation (KDE), which produces an empirical density function:\n\n1sns.displot(chicago_1918[\"influenza\"], kind=\"kde\", fill=True)\n\n\n1\n\nkind=\"kde\" specifies which type of a distribution plot should seaborn use and fill=True tells it to colour the area under the KDE curve.\n\n\n\n\n/home/runner/micromamba/envs/sds/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine and bar plots\nAnother very common way of visually displaying a variable is with a line or a bar chart. For example, if you want to generate a line plot of the (sorted) total cases by area:\n\n_ = chicago_1918[\"influenza\"].sort_values(ascending=False).plot()\n\n\n\n\nFor a bar plot all you need to do is to change from plot to plot.bar. Since there are many census tracts, let us plot only the ten largest ones (which you can retrieve with head):\n\n_ = chicago_1918[\"influenza\"].sort_values(ascending=False).head(10).plot.bar()\n\n\n\n\nYou can turn the plot around by displaying the bars horizontally (see how it’s just changing bar for barh). Let’s display now the top 50 areas and, to make it more readable, let us expand the plot’s height:\n\n_ = (\n    chicago_1918[\"total_population\"]\n    .sort_values()\n    .head(50)\n    .plot.barh(figsize=(6, 20))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne line or multiple lines?\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that in some cases, the code is on a single line, but longer code is split into multiple lines. Python requires you to follow the indentation rules, but apart from that, there are not a lot of other limits."

Feel free to skip it, move to the next, and return later when you feel more confident.\n\n\nOnce you can read your data in, explore specific cases, and have a first visual approach to the entire set, the next step can be preparing it for more sophisticated analysis. Maybe you are thinking of modeling it through regression, or on creating subgroups in the dataset with particular characteristics, or maybe you simply need to present summary measures that relate to a slightly different arrangement of the data than you have been presented with.\nFor all these cases, you first need what statistician, and general R wizard, Hadley Wickham calls “tidy data”. The general idea to “tidy” your data is to convert them from whatever structure they were handed in to you into one that allows convenient and standardized manipulation, and that supports directly inputting the data into what he calls “tidy” analysis tools. But, at a more practical level, what is exactly “tidy data”? In Wickham’s own words:\n\nTidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types.\n\nHe then goes on to list the three fundamental characteristics of “tidy data”:\n\nEach variable forms a column.\nEach observation forms a row.\nEach type of observational unit forms a table.\n\nIf you are further interested in the concept of “tidy data”, I recommend you check out the original paper (open access) and the public repository associated with it.\nLet us bring in the concept of “tidy data” to our own Chicago dataset.

It is not so for each of the three conditions:\n\nStarting by the last one (each type of observational unit forms a table), this dataset actually contains not one but many observational units: the different areas of Chicago, captured by geography_code; and different observatoins for each area. To tidy up this aspect, you can create separate tables. You will probably want population groups divided by age as one tidy table and flu rates as another. Start by extracting relevant columns.\n\n\n1influenza_rates = chicago_1918[[\"influenza\"]]\ninfluenza_rates.head()\n\n\n1\n\nYou are not selecting a single columns with chicago_1918[\"influenza\"] but a subset of columns.

To obtain a fully tidy version of the table, you need to re-arrange it in a way that every row is an age category in an area, and there are three variables: geography_code, age category, and population count (or frequency).\nBecause this is actually a fairly common pattern, there is a direct way to solve it in pandas:\n\ntidy_population = population.stack()\ntidy_population.head()\n\ngeography_code         \nG17003100001    agecat1     46\n                agecat2    274\n                agecat3    257\n                agecat4    311\n                agecat5    222\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThe method stack, well, “stacks” the different columns into rows. This fixes our “tidiness” problems but the type of object that is returning is not a DataFrame:\n\ntype(tidy_population)\n\npandas.core.series.Series\n\n\nIt is a Series, which really is like a DataFrame, but with only one column. The additional information (geography_code and age category) are stored in what is called an multi-index. You will skip these for now, so you would really just want to get a DataFrame as you know it out of the Series.

    "text": "Grouping, transforming, aggregating\nOne of the advantage of tidy datasets is they allow to perform advanced transformations in a more direct way. One of the most common ones is what is called “group-by” operations. Originated in the world of databases, these operations allow you to group observations in a table by one of its labels, index, or category, and apply operations on the data group by group.\nFor example, given our tidy table with age categories, you might want to compute the total sum of the population by each category. This task can be split into two different ones:\n\nGroup the table in each of the different subgroups.\nCompute the sum of count for each of them.\n\nTo do this in pandas, meet one of its workhorses, and also one of the reasons why the library has become so popular: the groupby operator.\n\npop_grouped = tidy_population_df.groupby(\"age_category\")\npop_grouped\n\n&lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x7f00e3fa9f90&gt;\n\n\nThe object pop_grouped still hasn’t computed anything. It is only a convenient way of specifying the grouping. But this allows us then to perform a multitude of operations on it. For our example, the sum is calculated as follows:\n\n1pop_grouped.sum(numeric_only=True)\n\n\n1\n\nYou want a sum of numeric values, not strings. Try it with numeric_only=False to see the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\n\n\nage_category\n\n\n\n\n\nagecat1\n50776\n\n\nagecat2\n275363\n\n\nagecat3\n201654\n\n\nagecat4\n259954\n\n\nagecat5\n206358\n\n\nagecat6\n1171345\n\n\nagecat7\n522130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can also obtain a summary of each group:\n\npop_grouped.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\nage_category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagecat1\n496.0\n102.370968\n78.677423\n0.0\n46.75\n82.0\n136.00\n427.0\n\n\nagecat2\n496.0\n555.167339\n423.526444\n3.0\n256.50\n442.5\n717.50\n2512.0\n\n\nagecat3\n496.0\n406.560484\n301.564896\n1.0\n193.50\n331.5\n532.50\n1917.0\n\n\nagecat4\n496.0\n524.100806\n369.875444\n4.0\n253.75\n453.5\n709.50\n2665.0\n\n\nagecat5\n496.0\n416.044355\n281.825682\n0.0\n220.50\n377.0\n551.75\n2454.0\n\n\nagecat6\n496.0\n2361.582661\n1545.469426\n8.0\n1169.75\n2102.0\n3191.75\n9792.0\n\n\nagecat7\n496.0\n1052.681452\n722.955717\n6.0\n519.75\n918.5\n1379.25\n4163.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will not get into it today as it goes beyond the basics this chapter wants to cover, but keep in mind that groupby allows you to not only call generic functions (like sum or describe), but also your own functions. This opens the door for virtually any kind of transformation and aggregation possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional reading\n\n\n\n\nA good introduction to data manipulation in Python is Wes McKinney’s “Python for Data Analysis” (McKinney 2012).\nTo explore further some of the visualization capabilities in at your fingertips, the Python library seaborn is an excellent choice. Its online tutorial is a fantastic place to start.\nA good extension is Hadley Wickham’s “Tidy data” paper (Wickham 2014), which presents a very popular way of organising tabular data for efficient manipulation."

The SIMD rankings are similar in structure to Chicago Influenza rates you have seen before, but not too much. Each row is allocated to a single area, but the table does not follow the “tidy” principles.\nTry answering the following questions about the dataset:\n\nWhich data zone is the most deprived (lowest ranking?) Which council area is it?\nCan you add a column with a proportion of the working age population in each data zone?\nWhich council area is, on average, the least deprived based on the Income domain?\nWhat is the total population of the “Glasgow City” council?\nCan you plot the ranking distribution in “Glasgow City”? How does it compare to the “City of Edinburgh”?\nCan you figure out how to create a scatter plot of a relationship between the education and health domain rankings?\nWhat else can you derive from the data?"
