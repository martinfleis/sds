This session is all about finding groups of similar observations in data using clustering
techniques.

Many questions and topics are complex phenomena that involve several dimensions and are
hard to summarise into a single variable. In statistical terms, you call this family of
problems *multivariate*, as opposed to *univariate* cases where only a single variable is
considered in the analysis. Clustering tackles this kind of questions by reducing their
dimensionality -the number of relevant variables the analyst needs to look at - and
converting it into a more intuitive set of classes that even non-technical audiences can
look at and make sense of. For this reason, it is widely used in applied contexts such as
policymaking or marketing. In addition, since these methods do not require many
preliminary assumptions about the structure of the data, it is a commonly used
exploratory tool, as it can quickly give clues about the shape, form and content of a
dataset.

The basic idea of statistical clustering is to summarise the information contained in
several variables by creating a relatively small number of categories. Each observation
in the dataset is then assigned to one, and only one, category depending on its values
for the variables originally considered in the classification. If done correctly, the
exercise reduces the complexity of a multi-dimensional problem while retaining all the
meaningful information contained in the original dataset. This is because once
classified, the analyst only needs to look at in which category every observation falls
into, instead of considering the multiple values associated with each of the variables
and trying to figure out how to put them together in a coherent sense. When the
clustering is performed on observations that represent areas, the technique is often
called geodemographic analysis.

Although there exist many techniques to statistically group observations in a dataset,
all of them are based on the premise of using a set of attributes to define classes or
categories of observations that are similar *within* each of them, but differ *between*
groups. How similarity within groups and dissimilarity between them is defined and how
the classification algorithm is operationalised is what makes techniques differ and also
what makes each of them particularly well suited for specific problems or types of data.

In the case of analysing spatial data, there is a subset of methods that are of
particular interest for many common cases in Spatial Data Science. These are the
so-called *regionalisation* techniques. Regionalisation methods can also take many forms
and faces but, at their core, they all involve statistical clustering of observations
with the additional constraint that observations need to be geographical neighbours to be
in the same category. Because of this, rather than category, you will use the term *area*
for each observation and *region* for each category, hence regionalisation, the
construction of regions from smaller areas.

The Python package you will use for clustering today is called `scikit-learn` and can
be imported as `sklearn`.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from libpysal import graph
from sklearn import cluster
```


## Attribute-based clustering

In this session, you will be working with another dataset you should already
be familiar with - the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. This time, you will focus
only on the area of Edinburgh prepared for this course.

### Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation

As always, the table can be read from the site:

```{python}
simd = gpd.read_file(
    "https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/clustering/data/edinburgh_simd_2020.gpkg"
)
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Alternative
Instead of reading the file directly off the web, it is possible to download it manually,
store it on your computer, and read it locally. To do that, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the file by right-clicking on
[this link](https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/clustering/data/edinburgh_simd_2020.gpkg)
and saving the file
2. Place the file in the same folder as the notebook where you intend to read it
3. Replace the code in the cell above with:

```python
simd = gpd.read_file(
    "edinburgh_simd_2020.gpkg",
)
```
:::

Inspect the structure of the table:

```{python}
simd.info()
```

Before you jump into exploring the data, one additional step that will come in handy
down the line. Not every variable in the table is an attribute that you will want for
the clustering. In particular, you are interested in sub-ranks based on individual SIMD
domains, so you will only consider those. Hence, first manually write them so
they are easier to subset:

```{python}
subranks = [
    "IncRankv2",
    "EmpRank",
    "HlthRank",
    "EduRank",
    "GAccRank",
    "CrimeRank",
    "HouseRank"
]
```

You can quickly familiarise yourself with those variables by plotting a few maps like
the one below to build your intuition about what is going to happen.

```{python}
#| classes: explore
simd[["IncRankv2", "geometry"]].explore("IncRankv2", tiles="CartoDB Positron", tooltip=False)
```

You can see a decent degree of spatial variation between different sub-ranks. Even
though you only have seven variables, it is very hard to "mentally overlay" all of them
to come up with an overall assessment of the nature of each part of Edinburgh. For
bivariate correlations, a useful tool is the correlation matrix plot, available in
`seaborn`:


```{python}
# | fig-cap: Pair plot of sub-ranks
_ = sns.pairplot(simd[subranks],height=1, plot_kws={"s":1})
```

This is helpful to consider uni and bivariate questions such as: *what is the
relationship between the ranks?* *Is health correlated with income?* However, sometimes,
this is not enough and you are interested in more sophisticated questions that are truly
multivariate and, in these cases, the figure above cannot help us. For example, it is
not straightforward to answer questions like: *what are the main characteristics of the
South of Edinburgh?* *What areas are similar to the core of the city?* *Are the East and
West of Edinburgh similar in terms of deprivation levels?* For these kinds of
multi-dimensional questions -involving multiple variables at the same time- you require
a truly multidimensional method like statistical clustering.

### K-Means

A cluster analysis involves the classification of the areas that make up a geographical
map into groups or categories of observations that are similar within each other but
different between them. The classification is carried out using a statistical clustering
algorithm that takes as input a set of attributes and returns the group ("labels" in the
terminology) each observation belongs to. Depending on the particular algorithm
employed, additional parameters, such as the desired number of clusters employed or more
advanced tuning parameters (e.g. bandwith, radius, etc.), also need to be entered as
inputs. For your classification of SIMD in Edinburgh, you will start with one of the most
popular clustering algorithms: K-means. This technique only requires as input the
observation attributes and the final number of groups that you want it to cluster the
observations into. In your case, you will use five to begin with as this will allow us
to have a closer look into each of them.

Although the underlying algorithm is not trivial, running K-means in Python is
streamlined thanks to `scikit-learn`. Similar to the extensive set of available
algorithms in the library, its computation is a matter of two lines of code. First, you
need to specify the parameters in the `KMeans` method (which is part of `scikit-learn`'s
`cluster` submodule). Note that, at this point, you do not even need to pass the data:

```{python}
kmeans5 = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42) # <1>
```
1. `n_clusters` specifies the number of clusters you want to get and `random_state` sets the random generator to a known state, ensuring that the result is always the same.

This sets up an object that holds all the parameters required to run the algorithm. To
actually run the algorithm on the attributes, you need to call the `fit` method in
`kmeans5`:

```{python}
kmeans5.fit(simd[subranks])  # <1>
```
1. `fit()` takes an array of data; therefore, pass the columns of `simd` with sub-ranks and run the clustering algorithm on that.

The `kmeans5` object now contains several components that can be useful for an analysis.
For now, you will use the labels, which represent the different categories in which you
have grouped the data. Remember, in Python, life starts at zero, so the group labels go
from zero to four. Labels can be extracted as follows:

```{python}
kmeans5.labels_
```

Each number represents a different category, so two observations with the same number
belong to the same group. The labels are returned in the same order as the input attributes
were passed in, which means you can append them to the original table of data as an
additional column:

```{python}
simd["kmeans_5"] = kmeans5.labels_
simd["kmeans_5"].head()
```

It is useful to display the categories created on a map to better understand the
classification you have just performed. For this, you will use a unique values
choropleth, which will automatically assign a different colour to each category:

```{python}
simd[["kmeans_5", 'geometry']].explore("kmeans_5", categorical=True, tiles="CartoDB Positron")
```

The map above represents the geographical distribution of the five categories created by
the K-means algorithm. A quick glance shows a strong spatial structure in the
distribution of the colours: group 3 (grey) is mostly in central areas and towards the
west, group 1 (green) covers peripheries and so on, but not all clusters are equally
represented.

::: {.callout-warning}
# Not all data can go to clustering in their raw form

Clustering, as well as many other statistical methods, often depends on pairwise distances
between observations based on the variables passed. That has, in practice, serious implications
on what can be used. For example, you cannot use one variable that is limited to a range between
0 and 1 and another that stretches from 0 to 100 000. The latter would dominate the distance
and the former would have negligible effect on the results. For these reasons, the data
usually need to be standardised in some way. See the [_Data_ section](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/10_clustering_and_regionalization.html#data) of
the chapter
[_Clustering and Regionalization_](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/10_clustering_and_regionalization.html)
from the Geographic Data Science with Python by @rey2023geographic for more details.

In this case, all the sub-ranks are defined the same way so you don't need any standardisation.
:::

### Exploring the nature of the categories

Once you have a sense of where and how the categories are distributed over space, it is
also useful to explore them statistically. This will allow you to characterise them,
giving you an idea of the kind of observations subsumed into each of them. As a first
step, find how many observations are in each category. To do that, you will make
use of the `groupby` operator introduced before, combined with the function `size`,
which returns the number of elements in a subgroup:

```{python}
k5sizes = simd.groupby('kmeans_5').size()
k5sizes
```

The `groupby` operator groups a table (`DataFrame`) using the values in the column
provided (`kmeans_5`) and passes them onto the function provided aftwerards, which in
this case is `size`. Effectively, what this does is to groupby the observations by the
categories created and count how many of them each contains. For a more visual
representation of the output, a bar plot is a good alternative:

```{python}
# | fig-cap: Bar plot of cluster sizes
_ = k5sizes.plot.bar()
```

As you suspected from the map, groups vary in size, with group 2 having over 200
observations, groups 0, 1 and 4 over 100 and a group 3 having 74 observations.

In order to describe the nature of each category, you can look at the values of each of
the attributes you have used to create them in the first place. Remember you used the
sub-ranks on many aspects of deprivation to create the classification, so you can begin
by checking the average value of each. To do that in Python, you will rely on the
`groupby` operator which you will combine with the function `mean`:

```{python}
k5_means = simd.groupby('kmeans_5')[subranks].mean()  # <1>
k5_means.T  # <2>
```
1. Use `groupby` to calculate mean per each sub-rank.
2. Transpose the table so it is not too wide

You can also visualise the table for each cluster using boxplots.

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(10, 3), sharey=True)

for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
    ax.set_title(f'Cluster {i}')
    ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)
    
    sns.boxplot(
        data=simd.loc[simd['kmeans_5'] == i, subranks],
        ax=ax
    )
```

When interpreting the values, remember that a lower value represents higher deprivation.
While the results seem plausible and there are ways of interpreting them, you haven't
used any spatial methods.

### Selecting the optimal number of clusters

K-means (and a lot of other algorithms) requires a number of clusters as an input argument.
But how do you know what is the right number? A priori, you usually dont. That is why
the clustering tasks normally contains a step aiming at determining the optimal number
of classes. The most common method is a so-called "elbow method".

The main prinicple is simple. You do clustering for a range of options, typically from 2
to $n$. Here, you can test all the options between 2 and 15, for example. For each result,
you measure some metric of cluster fit. The simple elbow method is using inertia, which
is a sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. But you can
also use other metrics like [Silhouette score](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html#sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score)
or [Calinski-Harabasz score](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabasz_score.html).

Loop over the options and save inertias per each option.
```{python}
inertias = {}  # <1>

for k in range(2, 15):  # <2>
    kmeans = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)  # <3>
    kmeans.fit(simd[subranks])
    inertias[k] = kmeans.inertia_  # <4>
```
1. Create an empty dictionary to hold the results computed in the loop.
2. Loop over a range of values from two to fifteen.
3. Generate clustering result for each `k`.
4. Save the inertia value to the dictionary.

Now you can create the _elbow plot_. On the resulting curve, you shall be looking for an
"elbow", a point where the inertia stops decreasing "fast enough", i.e. where the additional
cluster does not bring much to the model. In this case, it would be eithher 4 or 6.

```{python}
# | fig-cap: Elbow plot
_ = pd.Series(inertias).plot()
```

::: {.callout-tip}
# Check the 'optimal' result

Now that you know the optimal number, check how it looks on the map and what is the main
difference between 5, picked randomly, and the value derived from the elbow plot.
:::

The issue with the elbow plot is that the detection of the optimal number tends to be
ambiguous but thanks to its simplicity, it is used anyway. However, there is a range of
other methods that may provide a better understanding of cluster behaviour, like a
[clustergram](https://clustergram.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or a
[silhouette analysis](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html),
both of which are out of scope of this material.

## Spatially-lagged clustering

K-means (in its standard implementation) does not have a way of including of spatial
restriction. However, it is still a very powerful and efficient algorithm and it would
be a shame not to make a use of it when dealing with spatial data. To include spatial
dimension in (nearly any) non-spatial model, you can use spatially lagged variables.
Instead of passing in only the variables observed in each data zone, you also pass in
their spatial lags. Due to the nature of the spatial lag, this encodes a certain degree
of spatial contiguity into data that are being clustered, often resulting in spatially
more homogenous areas.

Start with building a queen contiguity weights matrix.

```{python}
queen = graph.Graph.build_contiguity(simd)
```

As always, you will need a row-standardised matrix.

```{python}
queen_row = queen.transform("R")
```

You need a lagged version of each of the sub-ranks as its own, new column. You can loop
through the `subranks` list and create them one by one, using a basic _for loop_.

```{python}
for column in subranks:                                 # <1>
    simd[column + "_lag"] = queen_row.lag(simd[column]) # <2>
```
1. For loop picks an item form `subranks`, assigns it to a `column` variable and runs the code inside the loop. Then it picks the second item from the list and runs the code again, with the second item as `column`. And so on until it covers the whole _iterable_ item.
2. In the first pass, `column` contains `"IncRankv2"`, so create a column called `"IncRankv2_lag"` with a spatial lag.

You can check that the `simd` table now has new columns.

```{python}
simd.info()
```

Let's create a list of these new columns.

```{python}
subranks_lag = [column + "_lag" for column in subranks]  # <1>
subranks_lag
```
1. This is also a for loop but in the form of a list comprehension. The whole loop is there to fill the values of the list.

Now, combine the list of original variables and those with a lag to make it easier to
pass the data to K-means.

```{python}
subranks_spatial = subranks + subranks_lag  # <1>
subranks_spatial
```
1. With arrays like `pandas.Series`, this would perform element-wise addition. With `list`s, this combines them together.

Initialise a new clustering model. Again, you could use the elbow or other methods to
determine the optimal number. Note that it may be different than before.

```{python}
kmeans5_lag = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
```

And run it using the new subset, adding lagged variables on top of the original ones.

```{python}
kmeans5_lag.fit(simd[subranks_spatial])
```

Assing the result as a column.

```{python}
simd["kmeans_5_lagged"] = kmeans5_lag.labels_
```

And explore as a map.

```{python}
simd[["kmeans_5_lagged", 'geometry']].explore("kmeans_5_lagged", categorical=True, tiles="CartoDB Positron")
```

Comparing the spatially-lagged clusters with the original results shows that the new
clusters are much more homogenous spatially, delineating relatively compact regions of
data zones.

You can also compare the distributions of variables between spatially-lagged clusters and original clusters.

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(5, 15), sharey=True, sharex=True)

for k in range(5):

    cluster_data = simd.loc[simd['kmeans_5'] == k, subranks]
    cluster_lagged = simd.loc[simd['kmeans_5_lagged'] == k, subranks]


    sns.boxplot(data=cluster_data, ax=axes[k, 0])
    axes[k, 0].set_title(f'Cluster {k}')
    axes[k, 0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)

    sns.boxplot(data=cluster_lagged, ax=axes[k, 1])
    axes[k, 1].set_title(f'Cluster {k} (lagged)')
    axes[k, 1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)
    ```

As you have seen, the essence of this approach is to group areas based on a purely
statistical basis: *where* each area is located is irrelevant for the label it receives
from the clustering algorithm. In many contexts, this is not only permissible but even
desirable, as the interest is to see if particular combinations of values are
distributed over space in any discernible way. However, in other contexts, you may be
interested in creating groups of observations that follow certain spatial constraints.
For that, you now turn to regionalisation techniques.

## Spatially-constrained clustering (regionalisation)

Regionalisation is the subset of clustering techniques that impose a spatial constraint
on the classification. In other words, the result of a regionalisation algorithm
contains areas that are spatially contiguous. While spatially lagged clustering may
result in contiguous areas, it does not enforce them. Regionalisation does. Effectively,
what this means is that these techniques aggregate areas into a smaller set of larger
ones, called regions. In this context, then, areas are *nested* within regions.
Real-world examples of this phenomenon include counties within states or, in Scotland,
data zones (`DZName`) into Local Authorities (`LAName`). The difference between those
examples and the output of a regionalisation algorithm is that while the former are
aggregated based on administrative principles, the latter follows a statistical
technique that, very much the same as in the standard statistical clustering, groups
together areas that are similar on the basis of a set of attributes. Only now, such
statistical clustering is spatially constrained.

As in the non-spatial case, there are many different algorithms to perform
regionalization, and they all differ on details relating to the way they measure
(dis)similarity, the process to regionalize, etc. However, same as above too, they all
share a few common aspects. In particular, they all take a set of input attributes *and*
a representation of space in the form of a binary spatial weights matrix. Depending on
the algorithm, they also require the desired number of output regions into which the
areas are aggregated.

To illustrate these concepts, you will run a regionalisation algorithm on the SIMD data
you have been using. In this case, the goal will be to delineate regions of similar
levels of deprivation. In this way, the resulting regions will represent a consistent
set of areas that are similar to each other in terms of the SIMD sub-ranks received.

At this point, you have all the pieces needed to run a regionalisation algorithm since
you have already created a queen contiguity matrix above. For this example, you will use
a spatially-constrained version of the agglomerative algorithm. This is a similar
approach to that used above (the inner workings of the algorithm are different, however)
with the difference that, in this case, observations can only be labelled in the same
group if they are spatial neighbours, as defined by your spatial weights matrix `queen`.
The way to interact with the algorithm is very similar to that above. You first set the
parameters:

```{python}
agg5 = cluster.AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=5, connectivity=queen.sparse)  # <1>
```
1. `scikit-learn` expects the connectivity graph as a sparse array, rather than a `libpysal.Graph`.

And you can run the algorithm by calling `fit`:

```{python}
agg5.fit(simd[subranks])
```

And then you append the labels to the table in the same way as before:

```{python}
simd["agg_5"] = agg5.labels_
```

At this point, the column `agg_5` is no different than `kmeans_5`: a categorical
variable that can be mapped into a unique values choropleth. In fact, the following code
snippet is exactly the same as before, only replacing the name of the variable to be
mapped and the title:

```{python}
simd[["agg_5", 'geometry']].explore("agg_5", categorical=True, tiles="CartoDB Positron")
```

::: {.callout-note}
# Optimal number of clusters

Five might not be the optimal number of classes when we deal with regionalisation as two
regions of the same characteristics may have to be disconnected. Therefore, the number of
clusters will typically be a bit higher than in the non-spatial case. Test yourself what
should be the optimal number here. Note that `AgglomerativeClustering` does not contain
`inertia_` property so you will need to derive some metric yourself.
:::

### Extracting the region boundaries

With this result, you may want to extract the boundaries of the regions, rather than
labels of individual data zones. To create the new boundaries "properly", you need to
dissolve all the polygons in each category into a single one. This is a standard GIS
operation that is supported by `geopandas`.

```{python}
simd_regions = simd[["agg_5", "geometry"]].dissolve("agg_5")    # <1>
simd_regions
```
1. If you are interested only in the boundaries, you can select just the two relevant
   colunms and dissolve geoemtries by values in the `"agg_5"` column. This uses
   `groubpy` under the hood, so you can potentially also aggregate other variables. See
   the
   [documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/aggregation_with_dissolve.html)
   on how.


```{python}
simd_regions.reset_index().explore("agg_5", categorical=True, tiles="CartoDB Positron")
```
