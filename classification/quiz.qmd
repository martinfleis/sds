:::::{.question}
**Which of the following statements best describes the difference between a Random Forest Regressor and a Random Forest Classifier?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
A Random Forest Regressor is used for continuous values, whereas a Random Forest Classifier is used for discrete categories.
:::

:::{.choice}
A Random Forest Regressor predicts discrete categories, while a Random Forest Classifier predicts continuous values.
:::

:::{.choice}
Both Random Forest Regressor and Classifier handle categorical data only.
:::

:::{.choice}
A Random Forest Classifier only outputs probability distributions.

:::::{.question}
**Cohenâ€™s Kappa is used to measure the agreement between predicted and actual classifications. What is a major advantage of using Kappa over simple accuracy?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Kappa accounts for imbalances in class distributions by considering chance agreement.
:::

:::{.choice}
Kappa only focuses on true positives and ignores false negatives.
:::

:::{.choice}
Kappa automatically adjusts for overfitting in the model.
:::

:::{.choice}
Kappa increases as the number of classes increases, regardless of model performance.

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following is a correct method for performing spatial cross-validation in a spatial machine learning model?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Randomly split the dataset into training and test sets without considering the geographic locations of data points.
:::

:::{.choice}
Use K-fold cross-validation by randomly assigning data points to folds, regardless of spatial proximity.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Ensure that training and test sets are drawn from spatially distinct regions, avoiding overlap between geographically close observations.
:::

:::{.choice}
Use a single train-test split based on temporal ordering rather than spatial separation.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following is an example of feature engineering in spatial data analysis?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Using `train_test_split` to split your dataset.
:::

:::{.choice}
Visualizing the distribution of data points on a map.
:::

:::{.choice}
Reducing the number of independent variables to improve model training speed.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Measuring the distance between geographic points to generate a proximity variable.
:::

::::

:::::{.question}
**What does spatial dependence in a dataset imply?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
The model predictions in one region depend on the values from distant, unrelated regions.
:::

:::{.choice}
Spatial dependence means that the dataset is temporally autocorrelated.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Observations that are closer together tend to have similar values due to their spatial proximity.
:::

:::{.choice}
The closer two points are, the less likely they are to have similar values.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following best defines spatial heterogeneity?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
The tendency for variables to be uniformly distributed across space.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
The variation in relationships between variables in different locations.
:::

:::{.choice}
The spatial uniformity in the feature importance of a model.
:::

:::{.choice}
The lack of correlation between variables at different locations.
